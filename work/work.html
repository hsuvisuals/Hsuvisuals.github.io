        <h3>Relationships, Digital Photo, 2018</h3>
        <p>Relationships. That is the title for my Glitch Art Project. My concept fell along the lines of what defines a good relationship. Whether it be with your parents, significant other, friends, boss, coworkers. Relationships are important for one to grow and become a better person. In my art work, the glitches represent the obstacles and hurdles that are thrown into the relationship and the visible parts of the subject represents how if the two parties can overcome and look pass these obstacles then they can see in to the future. Once they can see in the future and work things out, they have overcome the obstacles and grow together in the relationship. At first, I had some struggles with my files because it kept getting corrupted, but as I would just edit tiny pieces of the file in audacity, everything fit together well. </p>

        <h3>Ocean Waste, Digital Photo, 2018</h3>
        <p>When thinking about this project, I got the idea of making a hyperreal world of our oceans. Our oceans are filled with a bunch of waste every single day and we aren’t really doing too much about it for it to be fixed. Except I did read an article saying that some people are making this machine that would rid the Pacific of 90% of its waste by 2040. But in my world, I wanted to create an image on what if the trash continues to go into the ocean. I I added a color filter to my image to show what waste will do to the color of the water. I erased all life in the water to show nothing can live in this place. I changed the meaning by changing the mood of each image by changing the color of it and scale. I filled the whole canvas with a bunch of trash to show what would happen in the future if we don’t stop polluting the ocean. This image will function printed out large and be put on a wall or billboard with the tagline “what if our oceans looked like this?” </p>

        <h3>Driving Experience, Digital Photo, Audio File, 2018</h3>
        <p>In this sound project, I wanted to play with sounds that are created from a car. I got all my sounds from my 2008 Honda civic and put them together to create a symphony of driving sounds. I want my piece to be heard on headphones while the listener is sitting behind the wheel of a vehicle with vr goggles on with changing scenery landscapes. When someone drives a car, a lot of sounds are made but usually no one pays attention to those sounds. People usually play the radio or music and would usually hear those sounds instead. In this piece, I wanted to highlight the sounds that no one pays attention to when they operate a motor vehicle.</p>

        <h3>Parks and Recs SJ, Digital Video, 2018</h3>
        <p>I wanted to showcase some parks that people of San Jose frequent to hang out and do other activities. For this video, I would want to have its own room, with surround sound speakers. The video would be projected onto a white wall and chairs would be placed in front. I want this room to immerse the viewer into the video and be captivated by the cinematics.</p>

        <h3>Planet Flow, Program, 2019</h3>
        <p>
            I created a cool graphic that I call Planetflows. In this I created two classes for two different objects. I used Perlin Noise to create my particle field. In that class, I set the parameters of how I wanted the particles to behave. I made a jhrun() function to put all the methods together in which I can then put this one method into my draw loop. I then wrote jhshow() to display my drawing and jhupdate() to update it. I used jhedges() to set the bounds of my canvas. For my second class, it is called Planets. I also set the parameters on the behavior of planets with this class. I then used an array to manage all my planets. I wrote jhorbit() to allow my planets to orbit around a sun, jhspawnMoons() to display moons around each planet, and jhshow() to display my solar system. I also used frameCount() to manage when I want each graphic to display. The second event will happen after 500 frames, the next after 1200 frames and the last after 1800 frames.

        <h3>Hear the Bells, Website, 2017</h3>
        <p>I am exploring the capabilities of javascript with variables. I wanted to see if javascript could be used to make things disappear after they were clicked by the user. I wanted to create a game like an experience where the user has to figure out how to make it to the end of the page. One of my favorite artists is Porter Robinson and in his song Hear the Bells, the lyrics say "it's so far from me now. Oh, I can hear the sound." I wanted the user to use their ears to figure out which one was the right answer as well. I also wanted to see how javascript could be used to change some styles that CSS cant do.</p>

        <h3>Relationships, Website, 2018</h3>
        <p>In this piece, I am exploring further into the concepts of glitch art. Previously, in this class, we looked at how to do glitch art with audacity and photoshop. In this project, I am using CSS and Javascript to create the glitch art effects I have. The topic for this piece is about relationships. Out in public, couples are usually happy and put up a facade to others so that they seem like they are happy and that nothing is going on. However, in private, there could be numerous problems that are not seen by others. This project is to represent is a commentary on relationship abuse and how it is very common but hard to discover.</p>

        <h3>Another Day, Digital Video, 2019</h3>
        <p>
        Everyday is just another day. This video project speaks about the common struggles that college students encounter as they live their life. Students goes through numerous struggles and end up finding ways to cope with everything. Despite all the struggles, students should have a positive outlook. No matter how difficult things get or how bad the day is, it will be ok. Tomorrow will be a new one and things will seem better in the future. I made this video to remind my viewers that though it may seem bad now, but they will jump over the hurdles and everything will eventually be ok.

        <h3>Time, Website, 2019</h3>
        <p>
        Throughout the ages, ever since man discovered that they could tell time by putting a stick in the ground and using the the sun, clocks have always had a similiar style to it. It has always been a typical analog clock with arms for hours, minutes and seconds or a digital clock that tells you exactly what time it is. I decided to stray away from this common trend and attempted to make a clock that was different. The blue represents the hours, orange represents the minutes, purple represents the seconds, green represents the days, yellow represents the month, and red represents the year. My clock is also a 12 hour clock and the background color changes to represent AM or PM. A yellow color would mean AM and midnight blue would represent PM.

        <h3>Drawing Tools, Website, 2018</h3>
        <p>
        In this project, I created a drawing tool with Processing and Java. I wanted to create a drawing tool that allowed users to choose the size of their brush as well as the color. However, I did not want my tool to be like a typical drawing tool where you can use a brush to draw whatever you please. Instead for my drawing tool the user would click on the screen of wherever they want to draw. The 1 key would give them the square, 2 key would give a circle and 3 key would give a triangle. There are two toolbars on the left side where the user could select their desired color and size and paint away. At first, I had problems trying to have the size selection tool panel work. I could not get it to where the user could click on the size they want. Eventually, I figured out the math required to target those areas and my tool was complete.
