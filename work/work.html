    <h3>Relationships, Digital Photo, 2018</h3>
    <p>Relationships. That is the title for my Glitch Art Project. My concept fell along the lines of what defines a good relationship. Whether it be with your parents, significant other, friends, boss, coworkers. Relationships are important for one to grow and become a better person. In my art work, the glitches represent the obstacles and hurdles that are thrown into the relationship and the visible parts of the subject represents how if the two parties can overcome and look pass these obstacles then they can see in to the future. Once they can see in the future they have overcome the obstacles and grow together in the relationship. At first, I had some struggles with my files because it kept getting corrupted, but as I would just edit tiny pieces of the file in audacity, everything fit together well. </p>

    <h3>Ocean Waste, Digital Photo, 2018</h3>
    <p>When thinking about this project, I got the idea of making a hyperreal world of our oceans. Our oceans are filled with a bunch of waste every single day and we aren’t really doing too much about it for it to be fixed. Except I did read an article saying that some people are making this machine that would rid the Pacific of 90% of its waste by 2040. But in my world, I wanted to create an image on what if the trash continues to go into the ocean. I I added a color filter to my image to show what waste will do to the color of the water. I erased all life in the water to show nothing can live in this place. I changed the meaning by changing the mood of each image by changing the color of it and scale. I filled the whole canvas with a bunch of trash to show what would happen in the future if we don’t stop polluting the ocean. This image will function printed out large and be put on a wall or billboard with the tagline “what if our oceans looked like this?” </p>

    <h3>Driving Experience, Digital Photo, Audio File, 2018</h3>
    <p>In this sound project, I wanted to play with sounds that are created from a car. I got all my sounds from my 2008 Honda civic and put them together to create a symphony of driving sounds. I want my piece to be heard on headphones while the listener is sitting behind the wheel of a vehicle with vr goggles on with changing scenery landscapes.</p>

      <h3>Parks and Recs SJ, Digital Video, 2018</h3>
      <p>I wanted to showcase some parks that people of San Jose frequent to hang out and do other activities. For this video, I would want to have its own room, with surround sound speakers. The video would be projected onto a white wall and chairs would be placed in front. I want this room to immerse the viewer into the video and be captivated by the cinematics.</p>

    <h3>Cinematics, Website, 2018</h3>
    <p>I am exploring my past video work. I wanted to create a platform where cinematic videos could come to life and evoke emotions to the user. However, there is not much time to go out and film different cinematic videos so instead, I explored some of the videos I shot from 2014 till now and categorized them. To me, it is like a time capsule. I categorized them into favorite videos, nostalgic videos and adventure videos. I also wanted a minimalistic design so that the videos are the sole focus.</p>

    <h3>Hear the Bells, Website, 2018</h3>
    <p>I am exploring the capabilities of javascript with variables. I wanted to see if javascript could be used to make things disappear after they were clicked by the user. I wanted to create a game like an experience where the user has to figure out how to make it to the end of the page. One of my favorite artists is Porter Robinson and in his song Hear the Bells, the lyrics say "it's so far from me now. Oh, I can hear the sound." I wanted the user to use their ears to figure out which one was the right answer as well. I also wanted to see how javascript could be used to change some styles that CSS cant do.</p>
